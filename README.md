### Commit Message Convention

In this project, we follow a structured format for commit messages, making the commit history easier to read and understand. Here's our commit message format â†“

- `feat`: Adding new features or functionality.
- `fix`: Fixing bugs or issues.
- `docs`: Updating or adding documentation.
- `style`: Making code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).
- `refactor`: Refactoring existing code without changing its behavior.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests. No production code change.
- `chore`: Updating build tasks, package manager configurations, etc.

### Branch Naming Convention

Our branch names are also structured to reflect the purpose of the changes being made â†“

- For new features: `feat/description-of-feature`
- For bug fixes: `fix/description-of-fix`
- For documentation updates: `docs/update-description`
- For refactoring: `refactor/description-of-refactor`
- For chores: `chore/description-of-chore`

I am striving to adhere to this in my personal project.
